# AI Governance & Safety Checklist (Preview)

This page provides a **preview** checklist designed to balance:
- **Innovation**
- **Safety**
- **Human rights & privacy**
in practical AI adoption.

It is inspired by internationally discussed principles (e.g., OECD AI Principles) and real-world implementation needs.

> ⚠️ This is a **preview**.
> Decision thresholds, approval criteria, and exception handling are intentionally excluded.
> These must be designed per organization to avoid false confidence and over-restrictive governance.

## Quick Checklist (Preview)

| Category    | Question                                                | Why this matters (practical) |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Data        | Is input data classified by sensitivity and purpose?    | Without classification, rules become either unrealistic (too strict) or dangerous (too loose). |
| Security    | Can AI outputs trigger automated actions?               | If outputs can execute actions, mistakes become incidents, not just “bad answers.” |
| Development | Is AI usage integrated into existing workflows?         | Governance fails if it’s not embedded into how engineers actually work. |
| Privacy     | Are training and secondary use terms verified?          | “Hidden reuse” often becomes the biggest compliance and trust problem later. |
| Governance  | Is accountability defined before incidents occur?       | You can’t invent responsibility during an incident. Define it upfront. |
| Safety      | Is there a mechanism to pause or override AI decisions? | A practical “stop/override” path prevents small errors from becoming major damage. |
| [Hidden]    | (Available in full version)                             | Thresholds, exception criteria, and operational decision logic. |

## What is intentionally not included
To keep this preview safe and non-misleading, the following are omitted:
- Thresholds and decision logic (when to approve / deny / escalate)
- Exception approval workflow design
- Evidence/logging requirements tailored to your environment
- Risk acceptance criteria aligned to your business

If you need a checklist that your teams can actually operate, these parts must be designed with your architecture and constraints.
