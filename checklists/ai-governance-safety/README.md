# AI Governance & Safety Checklist (Preview)

This repository provides a **preview version** of an AI governance checklist
designed to bridge **innovation, safety, and human rights**.

The checklist is inspired by:
- OECD AI Principles
- Practical security engineering
- Privacy-by-design and accountability concepts

## Purpose
This preview helps organizations ask the *right questions* before deploying
generative AI in business processes.

## What this checklist covers
- Data sensitivity and usage context
- Human-in-the-loop design
- Accountability and responsibility boundaries
- Operational safety considerations

## What this checklist does NOT include
- Threshold values
- Decision logic
- Exception approval criteria
- Organization-specific risk appetite

These elements must be **designed per organization** and cannot be safely generalized.

## Why a preview
Publishing a complete checklist without context often leads to:
- False sense of security
- Over-restrictive rules
- Shadow AI usage

This preview intentionally focuses on **structure and perspective**, not answers.
